This tool discovers parallelism in the high-level design of a parallel application. It generates the may-happen-in-parallel (MHP) facts of tasks invoked by the parallel application. 


How to get this tool
--------------------

Get the tool from the github repository: https://github.com/anm-spa/MHP


Installation Requirements
-------------------------

You shall need the following tools and environment:

1) python (checked with the python version 2.7.9)

2)

You need to have the SWI prolog (http://www.swi-prolog.org/) installed and available in your shell command.  At ericsson environment (in one of the teamserver) you may check availability by the following command:

      Command: module avail swipl 

You may have either swipl/7.2.3(default) or swipl/7.3.11). Either of the version works fine, Command: module add swipl

Outside Ericsson environment, you may need to install it by yourself. Instruction is available at http://www.swi-prolog.org/build/unix.html for for Linux. Simple command sequences to install swipl are the following:

	git clone https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel.git
	cd swipl-devel
	./prepare
	cp -p build.templ build
	./build

Note that swipl should support sgml library to parse xml. 

3) You need to have the racer tool available which is developed under the clang/llvm environment. First, you may need to install llvm/clang which will take some time.
   
   #Installing llvm at the ericsson environment:
        git clone --recursive ssh://gerritmirror.rnd.ki.sw.ericsson.se:29418/flextools/llvm.git
	cd llvm
	tmp/build-test -l 4     
   
  #Installing llvm/clang outside ericsson environment
     Just follow the instruction at https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html 
  
  Once you have llvm and clang, now do the following to setup racer.

    cd (your llvm directory)/tools/clang/tools 
    git clone https://github.com/anm-spa/Racer.git
    
  open the CMakeLists.txt and add the following line in the file
     add_clang_subdirectory(Racer)
   
  now build llvm again which will install racer in the llvm binary directory

  Known BUG while building Racer
  ------------------------------

  CMake Error at tools/clang/tools/Racer/CMakeLists.txt:43 (target_link_libraries):
    The keyword signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with
    the target "racer".  All uses of target_link_libraries with a target must
    be either all-keyword or all-plain.

    The uses of the keyword signature are here:

     * cmake/modules/LLVM-Config.cmake:105 (target_link_libraries)
     * cmake/modules/AddLLVM.cmake:771 (target_link_libraries)


   ********If you get this bug or similar, you can try to get rid of it by just removing the keyword LINK_PRIVATE from the Racer/CMakeLists.txt file**** 


Install the MHP tool
--------------------

	git clone https://github.com/anm-spa/MHP.git mhp
	cd mhp
	
    Now, you can do test-install by running the command: make test-install, or make install    	
    
    If you do test-install, it will be able to test the examples provided in the mhp/test/ directory
    If you do general install, you should edit the Makefile in the mhp directory. Set BBDIR to the base directory of your application to be tested, and LLVMBIN directory to the directory of your LLVM binary directory in which the racer tool is available.
